a group of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings demand to learn 
the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, The Universe, and Everything 
from the supercomputer, Deep Thought, specially built for this purpose. 
It takes Deep Thought 7.5 million years to compute and check the answer, 
which turns out to be 42. Deep Thought points out that the answer seems 
meaningless because the beings who instructed it never actually knew 
what the Question was. When asked to produce The Ultimate Question, 
Deep Thought says that it cannot; however, it can help to design 
an even more powerful computer that can. This new computer
will incorporate living beings into the "computational matrix" and will
run for ten million years. 
It is revealed as being the planet Earth, with its pan-dimensional creators 
assuming the form of mice to observe its running. The process is hindered 
after eight million 
years by the unexpected arrival on Earth of 
the Golgafrinchans and then is ruined completely, five minutes before 
completion, when the Earth is destroyed by the Vogons to make way for 
a new Hyperspace Bypass. In The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, 
this is revealed to have been a ruse: the Vogons had been hired to destroy 
the Earth by a consortium of psychiatrists, led by Gag Halfrunt, 
who feared for the loss of their careers 
when the meaning of life became known.
Lacking a real question, the mice decide not to go through the whole 
thing again and settle for the out-of-thin-air 
suggestion "How many roads must a man walk down?" from Bob Dylan's 
song "Blowin' in the Wind".
